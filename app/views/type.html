            <p class="description">Mainly targets the prototyping of a new idea or the evaluation of a new capability (Web app, software, middle-ware, hardware,...). Total efforts should be limited to 3 Person-Month, 10,000 core-hours of compute, 1 TiB of storage and be limited to 3 month duration. At the end of the project, we expect the project PI to submit a project report of maximum 3 pages to the review panel and present the outcome of the project to a BBP tech/scientific talk.  Such project can only be prolonged once.</p>

            <p class="description">Targets the extension of a prototype already developed as part of a bronze project with the goal to bring it to a sustainable state. Total efforts should be limited to 12 Person-Month, 80,000 core-hours of compute, 10 TiB of storage and be limited to 6 month duration. At the end of the project, we expect the project PI to submit a project report of maximum 5 pages, give a presentation to the review panel and to BBP audience during a tech/scientific talk. Such project can only be prolonged once. Finally we strongly advise the project team to target the presentation of the results of this project to a scientific venue.</p>
